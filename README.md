## Computer Experience

My undergraduate major is Computer Science. While attending University at Buffalo I took cse115 and cse 116. Then while attending Dutchess Community College for a semester I took “Computer Science 3” which was honestly nothing that wasn’t covered in cse116. At SUNY New Paltz I have taken “Computer Science 3”, “Assembly Language and Computer Architecture”, and  “Principles of Programming Language.” Apart from these I've taken “Digital Logic Fundamentals”,  “Discrete and Continuous Algorithms”, and “Discrete Mathematics” and other courses like that which are related to computers but once again I figure you meant to mention real programming courses.

## Future Goals

This course seems to require you to understand deeply what's going on for both front and back end programming for the program we are creating. I see myself using this because I recently spoke to my cousin and he wanted me to look at his website which he made that he uses to showcase a couple projects he has made and leads to his github. So I see myself hopefully doing something similar to that and of course this course refines your skills and will give me more practice to make something more impressive than I can do currently.
